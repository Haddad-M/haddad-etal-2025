# About

This repository pertains to the paper in submission titled "Precision Glycans Enhance Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Production in Human Gut Model". 

This work demonstrates the selective impact of a synthetic glycan on the modulation of the gut microbiome in such a way that GABA production increases, offering a promising tool for modulating the gut-brain axis. 

# Components

The repository contains the primary R Markdown (.rmd) file used for analysis in the paper along with .csv files of sequencing, metabolomics, and fermentation data.
